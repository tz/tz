    <p>For years my dream has been to construct and live in a super-environmental dwelling. After a lot of ups and downs, I am finally closer than ever before, and the next step is to present my proposal to my neighborhood at a public meeting on October 14 hosted by <a href="https://nscaonline.org/">NSCA</a>. Stay tuned for more project details. Here is some useful info:</p>

    <p>Climate change is one of the biggest threats we face. It is already disrupting our agriculture, fishing, and forestry, exacerbating hurricanes, wildfires, and flooding, and creating climate refugees around the world. These disruptions will only increase in the coming decades. The financial costs of climate change could reach <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html">$70 Trillion</a>, and in one specific example of spending, New York City is considering a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/nyregion/sea-wall-nyc.html">$100 Billion sea wall</a> that may not even be adequate. The human costs include deaths, forced migrations, destroyed homes from storms and sea level rise, and the loss of treasured natural places. Because climate change disproportionately affects the poor and vulnerable, it is a social justice issue.</p>
    <p>In the developed world, housing and transportation are two of the biggest climate change contributors that people can affect through individual choices. I believe that will power is always in short supply, and that we must design our cities so that environmental choices are easy and practical.</p>
    <p>This project plans to be environmental by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Utilizing <a href="https://home.howstuffworks.com/home-improvement/construction/green/what-is-passive-house.htm">Pasive House</a> design to radically lower the energy needed for heating and cooling</li>
        <li>Sourcing building materials sustainably and avoiding <a href="https://living-future.org/declare/declare-about/red-list/">Red List</a> building materials</li>
        <li>Not using any natural gas whatsoever and using induction cooktops</li>
        <li>Incorporating rooftop solar panels</li>
        <li>Managing storm water and incorporating green roof elements</li>
        <li>Being located near public transportation (The El, multiple bus routes) and in a bikeable and walkable area to disincentivize car usage</li>
        <li>Having a classic brick facade and a focus on neutral, time-tested design elements that will have long lives, avoiding the waste of frequent renovations.</li>
        <li>Using land and building materials efficiently by having modestly sized units and an overall row-home design</li>
        <li>Multiplying these benefits by being a multi-family structure</li>
    </ul>
