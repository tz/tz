    <div class="intro-text">
        <p>I believe in simple design and deliberate planning. Professionally, I write web software and I love that I get to constantly learn more and improve. Some of my code is executed millions of times, so thoughtful design is imperative.</p>
        <p>In my free time I often walk and bicycle around Philadelphia where busy roads carry millions of person-trips over their lifetimes. Hence thoughtful design is critical here too, and I consistently advocate for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_streets">complete streets</a> policies that save lives and encourage environmental transportation options.<p>
        <p>When I'm not working or going to public meetings, you can find me playing and designing Magic decks, making stickers, or working on designing my future home. Get in touch at mail@<em>thiswebsite</em>.com</p>
