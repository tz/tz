<p>I design software, advocate for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_streets">complete streets</a>, play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurogame">Eurogames</a> obsessively, and enjoy live electronic music. I believe that will power is always in short supply; therefore we should design our houses, streets, and transit systems so that the easiest choices are also healthy and environmental. I'm currently designing a Passive House triplex that I will live in. Get in touch at mail@<em>thisdomain</em>.com .</p>
